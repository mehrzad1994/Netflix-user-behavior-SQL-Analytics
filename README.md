# Netflix User Behavior SQL Project ðŸŽ¬

## Overview
This project uses the **Netflix 2025 User Behavior Dataset** (210k+ records, 6 tables) to demonstrate advanced SQL, data modeling, and business intelligence techniques.  
The goal is to simulate real-world analytics tasks such as:
- Designing and normalizing database schemas
- Importing raw CSV data into SQL tables
- Writing analytical queries to uncover user behavior insights
- Building use cases for BI dashboards and business reporting

## Dataset
The dataset comes from [Kaggle: Netflix 2025 User Behavior](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sayeeduddin/netflix-2025user-behavior-dataset-210k-records).

- Users  
- Search history
- Content  
- Viewing activity  
- Ratings and reviews
- Recommendations

## Objectives
- Showcase **SQL skills**: table creation, joins, aggregations, window functions, CTEs
